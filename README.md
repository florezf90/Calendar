# florezf90 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Created with one simple mision, this calendar application allows the user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am&ndash;5pm) by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

It's achived by using dayjs, mixing it with a Jquery funciton that will style the timeslots depending of the actual time of the day.

## Built With

This application was built with JavaScript, Bootsrap, Dayjs, HTML & CSS
